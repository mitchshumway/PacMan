# PacMan Edge Detection Challenge

## Description and Roadmap

This project challenged me to push my knowledge of JavaScript. I had to come up with a way for PacMan to detect the edge of the screen and change direction upon coming in contact with it. I also learned how to use both setTimeout and setInterval to make it run perpetually. As uploaded, PacMan's movement is triggered by twice by setTimout, one inside the function and once outside of it, so that it runs automatically when you open it.
